"""
Use a dict comprehension to create a dict in which the keys are usernames and
the values are (integer) user IDs, based on a Unix-style /etc/passwd file. Hint:
in a typical /etc/passwd file, the usernames are the first field in a row (i.e.,
index 0), and the user IDs are the third field in a row (i.e., index 2). If you need
to download a sample /etc/passwd file, you can get it from http://mng.bz/
2XXg. Note that this sample file contains comment lines, meaning that youâ€™ll
need to remove them when creating your dict.
