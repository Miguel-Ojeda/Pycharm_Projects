"""
Create a Phone class that represents a mobile phone.
The phone should implement a dial method that dials a phone number (or simulates doing so).

Implement a SmartPhone subclass that uses the Phone.dial method
but implements its own run_app method.

Now implement an iPhone subclass that implements not only a run_app method,
but also its own dial method, which invokes the parentâ€™s dial method
but whose output is all in lowercase as a sign of its coolness.
