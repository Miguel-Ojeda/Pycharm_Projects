"""
Bags. A bag is a collection where removing items is not supportedâ€”its purpose is to
provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected
items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items).
The order of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client.
With our Bag API, a client can add items to a bag and process them
all with a foreach statement whenever needed.
Such a client could use a stack or a queue, but one way to emphasize that the order in
which items are processed is immaterial is to use a Bag.
