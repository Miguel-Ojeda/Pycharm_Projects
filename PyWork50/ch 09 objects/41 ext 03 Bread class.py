"""
Define a Bread class representing a loaf of bread.

We should be able to invoke a get_nutrition method on the object,
passing an integer representing the number of slices we want to eat.

In return, weâ€™ll receive a dict whose key-value pairs will represent
calories, carbohydrates, sodium, sugar, and fat, indicating
the nutritional statistics for that number of slices.

Now implement two new classes that inherit from Bread, namely WholeWheatBread and RyeBread.

Each class should implement the same get_nutrition method, but with different
nutritional information where appropriate.
