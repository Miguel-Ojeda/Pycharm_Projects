"""
Write a generator function, file_usage_timing, that takes a single directory name as an argument.
With each iteration, we get a tuple containing not just the current filename,
but also the three reports that we can get about a fileâ€™s most recent usage:
its access time (atime), modification time (mtime), and creation time (ctime).
Hint: all are available via the os.stat function.
